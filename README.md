# UVM_Verifivation_To_Memory
Developed a UVM verification environment from scratch and used it to verify the functionality of a memory where I used random testing, constrained random testing, and directed testing to check the corner cases of the design and also checked the coverage of the design and ensured that I got 100% functional and code coverage
